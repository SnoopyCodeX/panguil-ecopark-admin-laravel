## About this project

This is a web-based admin system for Panguil EcoPark and Resort which is made using Laravel + Vite and Bootstrap. The admin dashboard template used was from <a href="https://www.nobleui.com">NobleUI.com</a>. This system features:

- Quick summaries of total tourists visited in the current year and previous year, registered tourists, reservations and assigned tourists.
- The dashboard itself also shows the reminders
- Complete list of registered tourists
- Complete list of reservations

This admin system was built and made specifically for Panguil EcoPark and Resort so that it will be easier for them to keep track of their data and manage each tourist and tour guides' informations.

## Building Project

Download dependencies:

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

Copy .env.example to .env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run artisan command:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

Next, open `.env` file and find and replace these keys' values with your own [pusher](https://pusher.com) account credentials and database credentials:

```
DB_DATABASE=[YOUR DATABASE NAME]
DB_USERNAME=[YOUR DATABASE USERNAME]
DB_PASSWORD=[YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD]

PUSHER_APP_ID=[YOUR PUSHER APP ID]
PUSHER_APP_KEY=[YOUR PUSHER APP KEY]
PUSHER_APP_SECRET=[YOUR PUSHER APP SECRET]
```

Next, run migration to generate all the tables:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Next, run this command to create a default admin account for the system:

```bash
php artisan app:create-admin
```

The default admin email address and password is:

```
Email: tatel@gmail.com
Password: test123
```

Next, run this command twice (*for some reason it doesn't take effect by running once*) if you want to run the system in development mode:

```bash
php artisan app:run-as-dev
```

Hit `Ctrl+C` to stop and then execute it again. Then it will work, then just open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. By default, the system is hosted on port `8000`.

To run the system in production mode, you just do the same thing but with this command:

```bash
php artisan app:run-as-prod
```

*Note: When executing `php artisan app:run-as-dev` and `php artisan app:run-as-prod` while in __production mode__, you will be prompted in the console. When that happens, just type `yes` on each prompts and press `Enter`.*

## Generating PHP Docs

Just execute these commands:

```bash
# Generate php docs for laravel facades
php artisan ide-helper:generate

# Generate php docs for laravel models
# You will be prompted in the console, just type no.
php artisan ide-helper:models
```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
